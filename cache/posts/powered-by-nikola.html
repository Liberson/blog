<p>Nikola is a static site generator created by a member of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://python.org.ar/pyar">PyAr</a> community (Roberto Alsina).
It is a great project and the pythonic-way I choose to blog again...</p>
<p>I hope to contribute to the project in the near future
(I promise to Roberto to send some improvements but I have not pull-requested to github yet...
I will do it soon).</p>
<p>The web-page of the project is <a class="reference external" href="http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar">http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar</a> , powered by itself, of course!</p>
<p>Enjoy it!</p>

<p>PS: The theme you are seeing right now it is not included in the Nikola themes folder,
I will post it soon...</p>
