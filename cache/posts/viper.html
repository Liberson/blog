<p>vIPer is an application specifically designed to work with
<a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a> notebooks.</p>
<p>It is a Python project I have been developing for the last weeks...</p>
<p>Here, you can see a video of one of my beloved features, a direct slide-show mode
for working notebooks:</p>

because I did not win the SciPy sponsorship and Texas is far from here (Argentina),
not only in miles, but also in money. So, most probably, I will show it in the next PyConAr.</p>
<p>Obviously, vIPer will be available soon...</p>
<p>See you!</p>
