    "## JupyterLab continuous evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab continue with its evolution into the future. The beta phase is behind us and it is ready for daily usage. So, I recomend you to try it and report back any issue and suggestion. There is also a proliferation of JupyterLab extensions that show us the infinit potential power behind JupyterLab and how the well thought architecture allows you to customize almost every aspect in the application.\n",
